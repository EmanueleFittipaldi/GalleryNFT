# GalleryNFT
GalleriaNFT is an Ethereuem dApp that allows you to buy a painting and get the possession of it, based on the concept of minting a non-fungible token called 'Paint'.
The basic requirement for the purchase is to create a metamask wallet and connect it.
The dApp was developed with the Solidity language, also using Truffle (a development environment that uses Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM) and Ganache.
